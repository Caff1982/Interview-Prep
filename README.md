# Interview-Prep

## Contributing

Please feel free to add any of the solutions you have. I have created a folder for Python Solutions and all of these have been made by me so far, I'd like everyone to post their run times inside the solutions as well, I'll soon be moving these directions to contributing.md, but it hasn't been created yet.
This is how it would be preferred.
```
Time Taken(%):
Memory usage(%):
Your Name(optional):
// Your solution here
```
As you may see, I haven't added that for my solutions but I soon will, all solutions are written so far in Python.<strong> One solution per PR will be denied</strong>. <strong>At least 3 solutions per PR.</strong> 
This repo isn't meant to be solely for <strong>hacktoberfest</strong> but also for all of the people who are preparing for interviews.

All other languages' solutions are welcome.

Please follow this file format - 

`Question Number-space-Question Name.extension`

Thank you very much!
